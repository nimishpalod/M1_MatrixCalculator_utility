# Description
Matrix Calculator is a software designed in C-language which will allow the users to do major matrix operations like addition, multiplication, transpose, subtraction or finding determinant of a matrix by simply giving some inputs which includes type of operation, matrix elements, number of rows and columns and they will get the required output. Manually matrix operations consumes a lot of time to bring result and that too not guaranteed correct, so this software will help all those users who work with matrices on daily basis by saving their much of efforts and time. This project allows user to enter matrices of any dimensions (possible as per the operations), not limited to the square matrix only.
# Requirements
## High Level Requirements 
* Addition of two matrix
* Subtraction of two matrix
* Multiplication of two matrix
* Transpose of matrix
* Determinant of matrix
## Low Level Requirements
* Selecting the operation
* Number of Rows 
* Number of Columns
* For addition and subtraction both the matrices should be of same dimensions
* For multiplication number of columns of first matrix should be equal to number of rows of second
* Elements of matrices for each index number
* For determinant the matrix should be square matrix
