# M1_MatrixCalculator_utility
Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we involves in various types of calculations around us. Matrices are the mathematical entity which has a lot of applications in real life. Matrix Calculator is a software designed in C-language which will allow the users to do major matrix operations like addition, multiplication, transpose, subtraction or finding determinant of a matrix by simply giving some inputs which includes type of operation, matrix elements, number of rows and columns and they will get the required output. Manually matrix operations consumes a lot of time to bring result and that too not guaranteed correct, so this software will help all those users who work with matrices on daily basis by saving their much of efforts and time. This project allows user to enter matrices of any dimensions (possible as per the operations), not limited to the square matrix only.
